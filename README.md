# Satellite coordination system
#### By Melina Roc√≠o Morales

This project was made for a fellowship for https://imaginefellowships.com/ .

For this project I use React with Axios library and CSS.  

### Project statement

* Create a frontend UI that displays a list of all satellite launches. You can fetch the launch data at https://api.spacexdata.com/v5/launches/ .  

* Add ability for a user to search by satellite name.  

* Bonus: add a date filter to allow users to select a date and only show satellites launched after that date.  

* Bonus: add a checkbox to allow users to select only successful launches.
